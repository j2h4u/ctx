# Architecture Reviews

Record architecture review checkpoints and sign-offs.

## Status

- Final local architecture/security review is complete for current `HEAD`.
- No architecture blockers remain for the declared local-only scope.
- Hosted/team/enterprise/control-plane runtime surfaces remain out of public
  ctx for this branch; remaining local `account_id`/`org_id` migration fields
  are compatibility/provenance cleanup, not hosted authority exposure.

## Plan Review Baseline

- Reviewer Ohm inspected the branch direction and first draft. Findings around
  Work source-of-truth, CLI/import/export, plugin security, hot reload, ACP
  provider contract, UX artifacts, review gates, and subagent workflow were
  incorporated into `exec_plan.md`.
- Reviewer Locke inspected the updated plan. Findings around SDK scope,
  storage semantics, ACP conformance, bundle safety, declarative data/action
  contracts, network-adjacent boundaries, and worker base-commit rules were
  incorporated into `exec_plan.md`.

Reviewer agents:

- Ohm: `019ee0b6-defd-7c51-be16-514e06259ca5`
- Locke: `019ee0bb-d702-7541-811a-585a218a38d1`

## Blocking Contract Base

- `3d1b60a` documents the Work namespace, Work source-of-truth/storage,
  ACP provider plugin, and plugin contribution contracts. Broad implementation
  workers must base on this commit or a later manager-owned contract commit.

## Contract Gap Review

- Reviewer Boyle (`019ee0c6-f450-7f50-bf4f-e48fa2bad5ee`) found six contract
  gaps after `3d1b60a`: diagnostics durability, importer write boundaries, ID
  collision policy, ACP target drift, old control-plane import semantics, and
  concrete worker write ownership.
- The manager resolved the first five by adding durable diagnostics, approved
  import/capture actions, ID-class collision rules, a local ACP v1 conformance
  target, and old control-plane historical import boundaries.
- Worker write ownership remains manager-enforced per spawned worker; no broad
  overlapping plugin/provider/runtime workers should start until each write set
  is assigned explicitly.
- Current contract base after this review is `8123c74`.

## Harness Starter Hooks Review

- Reviewer Linnaeus (`019ee13c-cf32-7380-99d1-da5531f859ae`) reviewed commit
  `725edbf` and found no blockers.
- Sign-off: OK to keep integrated.
- Findings: the docs preserve ACP as the public provider protocol, keep CRP as
  internal/native compatibility, describe the harness starter as optional future
  scaffolding rather than a competing protocol, exclude hosted/team/enterprise
  scope, and avoid trademark/positioning risk.
- Non-blocking docs organization suggestion: move the harness boundary link out
  of the top docs "Start here" list. The manager applied this by placing the
  link under an Examples heading in `docs/README.md`.

## Declarative Plugin Contribution Contract Review

- Reviewer Poincare (`019ee1b3-9618-7ba2-b6d6-47bf1d4f5340`) reviewed worker
  commit `276b773` after earlier blocker fixes and found no remaining blockers.
- The slice keeps the public plugin contract manifest-first: ACP/provider,
  command, collector, observer, and `ui_surfaces` remain the executable/local
  runtime buckets; new Workbench `templates`, `toolbar_actions`,
  `artifact_renderers`, `card_renderers`, `detail_sections`, and
  `review_sections` are declarative host-owned buckets only.
- The contract explicitly does not introduce arbitrary React/webview execution
  or redaction/export processor execution in the manifest. Processor markers
  remain SDK sidecars until provenance, permissions, and lifecycle semantics are
  specified.
- Toolbar `command` targets now mean declared commands in the same plugin,
  while `action` targets remain an approved ctx action enum.
- Residual architecture note: JSON Schema can validate target shape but cannot
  enforce same-manifest command cross-reference. That parity is enforced in the
  SDK and Rust model tests.

## Declarative Plugin Registry And Workbench Projection Review

- Reviewer Banach confirmed the Rust registry/daemon projection direction:
  daemon extension registry records now carry the same six host-owned
  declarative Workbench buckets exposed by the public SDK and Rust model.
- The manager addressed Banach's web-store gap by integrating and correcting
  the frontend registry normalization path, so daemon-projected `templates`,
  `toolbar_actions`, `artifact_renderers`, `card_renderers`,
  `detail_sections`, and `review_sections` are not dropped before Workbench
  projection.
- Reviewer Rawls' initial blocker was resolved by ordering integration so the
  backend registry shape landed before frontend projection, then removing the
  temporary local registry casts.
- The slice remains host-owned and inert: renderer/template IDs are data
  contracts over existing Workbench primitives, not arbitrary plugin React,
  webview, or process execution.
- Residual architecture note: public docs still need a later pass that clearly
  names the initial host renderer/template vocabulary and how future IDs become
  supported.

## Slash Command Source Labels Review

- Reviewer Herschel confirmed no source-label implementation blockers after
  fixes. Provider and plugin slash commands now remain route-preserving while
  displaying source labels for collision clarity.
- The manager corrected the test shape to cover the real provider/plugin
  collision path: provider `/review` and plugin `/review.tools:review`.
- Source labels do not change invocation authority. Plugin command routing
  still requires the namespaced plugin token and resolves through
  `resolvePluginCommandMessage`.
- Residual architecture note: richer command collision diagnostics can later
  consume daemon plugin diagnostics, but this UI slice stays presentation-only.

## Local Plugin CLI Review

- Reviewer Epicurus confirmed the CLI validates manifests through the shared
  Rust `PluginManifest` model plus `manifest.validate()`, matching the daemon
  loader's core manifest contract.
- The manager narrowed `ctx plugin list` and `ctx plugin reload` to explicit
  local scanner semantics. Both human and JSON output now include
  `local_scan`, so users do not confuse offline diagnostics with a live daemon
  reload.
- Default root resolution now delegates to `PluginInventoryRuntime::new` after
  preparing the data root. That keeps explicit roots, `CTX_PLUGIN_ROOTS`, empty
  env entries, and fallback data-root behavior aligned with daemon inventory
  loading instead of maintaining duplicate root logic in the CLI.
- The slice intentionally does not introduce daemon-connected reload/apply,
  per-plugin reload, plugin dev processes, or log streaming. Those should be
  added as separate lifecycle-aware slices that preserve active-session safety
  and provider adapter sync semantics.

## Public Local Boundary And Workbench Composition Review

- The public repo branch now treats hosted/team control-plane surfaces as out of
  scope, not dormant public API. Organization policy, daemon enrollment, hosted
  policy snapshot, run-archive ingest service routes, route contracts, public
  crates, and Cargo/Bazel targets have been removed from the public local slice.
- Legacy SQLite compatibility is handled as local migration repair and reserved
  migration slots. This keeps existing local stores openable without preserving
  hosted/team authority concepts in the public product model.
- Workbench extensibility remains composability-first: built-in Classic, Kanban,
  Multipane, and Review templates share host-owned primitives; plugins
  contribute declarative data that projects into those primitives with source
  labels and compatibility diagnostics.
- Hot reload in this branch is a local inventory/declarative projection loop.
  It can add/change/remove plugin contribution data and preserve active session
  UI state, but it does not yet execute plugin UI code, mutate Work records from
  plugin UI, or apply daemon-connected provider adapter changes in place.
- Architecture confidence: this is the right local direction for unifying the
  ADE and former control-plane concepts. Remaining uncertainty is not around the
  substrate; it is around the next executable extension boundary. That should be
  designed as a follow-on permission/lifecycle slice, not squeezed into the
  current declarative projection work.

## Final Current-HEAD Architecture Review

- Reviewer Anscombe (`019ee2c2-4fd0-7322-b9b8-65b60e19ec1f`) reviewed current
  `HEAD` and `HEAD~4..HEAD` read-only after the final cleanup commits.
- Result: PASS for architecture/security local scope; no blockers found.
- Non-blocking notes: local run/audit schema retains `account_id`, `org_id`,
  and retention fields for local provenance/repair compatibility; migration
  repair is bounded to exact legacy descriptions; CLI plugin reload remains
  labeled as local scanner behavior; `/api/plugins/reload` remains the local
  daemon inventory route used by ADE/E2E; settings no longer wire
  billing/team/enterprise/mobile-access sections.
