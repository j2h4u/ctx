# Work Inspector Full Suite Implementation Status

Updated: 2026-06-22T00:34:56-05:00

Branch: `ctx/agent-work-semantics-primary`

Base implementation commit: `87575cc Build Work Inspector capture suite`

Final implementation/hardening commit reviewed: `a6fac71 Harden Work Inspector
validation and docs`.

Status: validation passed locally. The first dedicated done-ness review on
`a6fac71` found the substantive implementation complete and failed only this
status note's stale bookkeeping. The first status-only follow-up commit was
`711c51a Record Work Inspector review status`; the reviewer then failed only the
remaining "re-check pending" wording. This current status-only commit records
that second result and intentionally identifies itself as current `HEAD` because
a Git commit cannot embed its own final hash without changing that hash.

## Scope Landed

- Replaced the thin Work Report surface with a typed Work Inspector at the
  stable route `/workspaces/:id/work/:workId`.
- Added typed report v2 API projections for overview, transcript/context,
  commands, evidence, timeline, changes, artifacts, trust, and whitelist raw
  JSON.
- Added the Work Inspector UI with dashboard-style header, metrics, tabs,
  right-rail context, safe raw JSON projection, failure state, dark/light
  support, and mobile layout coverage.
- Added ADE/session projection and explicit CLI capture coverage for Work
  records, evidence command previews, deterministic git/PR metadata capture,
  import/export/search/context, and freshness/trust material.
- Added the session-artifact to Work-artifact bridge with safe typed metadata,
  authenticated artifact URLs, MIME handling, and executable-content download
  behavior for SVG/HTML.
- Added dogfood generation for five scratch projects and opened their Work
  Inspector pages in Chrome.
- Added docs and README language that positions Work records and the Work
  Inspector as the primary product surface, with ADE as optional.
- Hardened local development verification by using `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh`
  with a global Cargo lock, low I/O priority, memory cgroup, one Cargo job, one
  Rust test thread, and short disk-backed `TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ctxwi`.

## API Contract Summary

The Work Inspector route exposes typed, share-safe fields rather than compacted
text or arbitrary raw records:

- `overview`: objective/title/status/provenance/trust/freshness.
- `transcript` and `context`: bounded, redacted message/context previews.
- `commands`: command metadata, exit status, timestamps, and bounded redacted
  stdout/stderr previews.
- `evidence`: verification state, freshness, citations, and command links.
- `timeline`: ordered events with source IDs and redacted display payloads.
- `changes`: linked commits, pull requests, and change-set metadata.
- `artifacts`: safe artifact metadata, thumbnails/download links where safe,
  and unavailable placeholders when source artifacts are missing.
- `raw_redacted_json`: an explicit whitelist projection only. It is not a
  recursive dump of local/private raw data.

Default route responses, DOM, screenshots, search, and agent-readable JSON omit
raw transcripts, raw command output, raw local paths, auth material, and
private/local-only blobs.

## Broad Verification Findings And Fixes

The final broad Rust verification was not treated as a rubber stamp. It exposed
several unrelated but release-relevant local failures, all fixed before the
final pass:

- `/tmp` tmpfs pressure caused SQLite `disk I/O error` during broad workspace
  tests. Mitigation: reran broad Cargo gates with short disk-backed
  `TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ctxwi`.
- A long scratch `TMPDIR` caused provider-account Unix socket path failures
  with `SUN_LEN`. Mitigation: kept the short `/var/tmp/ctxwi` temp root.
- `ctx_ui_sized_active_session_head_recovery_is_bounded` counted live
  projection rows as fixture rows. Fix: count only the intended UI-tool fixture
  IDs.
- `project_session_command_backfills_ade_session_work` relied on fixture state
  visibility that was not guaranteed across store managers. Fix: assert the
  persisted event before projecting.
- No-repo session diff and task-default-session tests inherited parent Git
  repositories from scratch directories. Fix: root-scoped repository checks now
  require a `.git` or `.jj` marker at the workspace root.
- Queued cancel lifecycle tests depended on timing. Fix: fake provider now has
  a deterministic `hold-after-tool-call` marker.
- Repeated workspace VCS stream subscription saw pre-repeat queued VCS messages.
  Fix: drain queued VCS messages before the repeat-subscribe assertion.
- Pull request inspector links with `target_id` but no `target_json` lacked
  owner/repo/number projection. Fix: bounded fallback parser for
  `provider:owner/repo#number`.

## Dogfood Records

Scratch root:

`/home/daddy/code/ctx-multi-repo-workspace/scratch/work-inspector-full-suite-20260621-145857`

The five Work Inspector pages were generated and opened in Chrome against the
local dogfood daemon on `127.0.0.1:4401`. URLs below intentionally omit any auth
token.

## Reviewer Status

- Architecture/data-model review: PASS.
- Security/privacy review: PASS. Reviewer confirmed default public surfaces use
  typed share-safe projections and avoid raw/local/private leakage.
- Visual review: PASS across populated desktop dark, desktop light, mobile dark,
  commands, artifacts, raw JSON, and missing-record failure state.
- Fresh dogfood reconstruction review: PASS, 5/5 records reconstructable from
  the Work Inspector plus redacted agent-readable JSON alone.
- Dedicated final done-ness review on `a6fac71`: substantive PASS; temporary
  bookkeeping FAIL because this status file still said final review and hygiene
  were pending. No product, architecture, security, visual, test, dogfood, or
  deferral blockers were found.
- Final re-check on `711c51a`: implementation still PASS; temporary bookkeeping
  FAIL because this file still said the re-check was pending and did not mention
  `711c51a`.
- Current status-only `HEAD`: records the final re-check results above. No code,
  product, architecture, security, visual, test, dogfood, or deferral blockers
  remain in the recorded reviewer feedback.

## Validation

Passed:

- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh test --manifest-path Cargo.toml --workspace --locked`
  with `CTX_CARGO_JOBS=1 CTX_RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ctxwi`.
- `scripts/dev/cargo-safe.sh build --manifest-path Cargo.toml --workspace --locked`
  with `CTX_CARGO_JOBS=1 TMPDIR=/var/tmp/ctxwi`.
- `pnpm --dir core/apps/web typecheck`.
- `pnpm --dir core/apps/web lint`.
- `pnpm --dir core/apps/web test`:
  253 files passed, 1956 tests passed.
- `pnpm --dir core/apps/web build`.
- `CTX_E2E_FORCE_REUSE_SERVER=1 CTX_E2E_PORT=4401 CTX_E2E_BROWSER=chromium CTX_E2E_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome CTX_E2E_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1 CTX_E2E_DISABLE_VIDEO=1 pnpm --dir core/apps/web exec playwright test e2e/visual-work-inspector.spec.ts`:
  5 tests passed. The local auth token was supplied from the dogfood data root
  and was not recorded.

Final hygiene already passed before commit `a6fac71`:

- `cargo fmt --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml --all -- --check`.
- `git diff --check`.
- `git status --short`.

## Accepted Deferrals

- Hosted/team/enterprise sync remains out of scope for this public local pass.
- Optional LLM summaries remain off by default and are not evidence.
- Raw local/private transcript/data-lake material remains excluded from default
  route responses, DOM, screenshots, search, status files, and agent-readable
  JSON.
- Global arbitrary command shimming remains deferred. Deterministic capture is
  via ADE/session projection, explicit `ctx work evidence ... run -- ...`, and
  git/gh metadata/link capture.
- Dogfood records that did not have linked session artifact IDs show safe
  unavailable artifact placeholders. This is correct for the current records and
  does not leak raw paths.
