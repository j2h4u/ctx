# Work Observability And Legibility Implementation Status

Task: `feb64c1c-e58c-40f8-b1e9-1094dca0646e`
Branch: `ctx/agent-work-semantics-primary`
Worktree: `/home/daddy/code/ctx-multi-repo-workspace/worktrees/ctx/agent-work-semantics-primary`
Starting head: `bf11a2c Record Work productization follow-up`

## Manager plan

1. Commit this reviewed implementation plan and status baseline.
2. Map existing storage, CLI, daemon, web, redaction, and artifact surfaces.
3. Implement the P0 local Work observability slice in narrow, reviewable commits:
   store/model, capture/indexing, CLI/API contract, Work Report UI, docs.
4. Keep hosted/team/enterprise, remote push, PR, release, and broad remote CI out
   of scope.
5. Use resource-safe Rust commands and avoid concurrent broad Cargo runs on this
   host.
6. Run focused validation after each slice, then adversarial review subagents.
7. Record final validations, accepted deferrals, and done-ness review result in
   this plan directory before final response.

## Subagents

Read-only exploration started:

- Data/store explorer: `019ee7e1-13d2-7bc3-9dca-bff96d91e067`
- CLI/API explorer: `019ee7e1-31b8-7ab1-b1bf-456f5f725fe4`
- Web/ADE explorer: `019ee7e1-46c2-7b83-9cd9-1c7a197d6bbd`
- Redaction/artifact explorer: `019ee7e1-7449-7951-ad5d-a3c5af54db75`

Planned implementation/review teams:

- Data model/store worker
- Capture/indexing worker
- CLI/agent-contract worker
- Daemon/API worker
- Work Report UI worker
- Docs/product worker
- Architecture/data-model reviewer
- Product/UX reviewer
- Agent-contract reviewer
- Security/privacy reviewer
- Test-coverage reviewer
- SDLC/resource-safety reviewer
- Final done-ness reviewer

## Status log

- Baseline plan read. Canonical branch/worktree verified.
- Repo-local `AGENTS.md` was not present in this worktree; parent workspace
  instructions apply.
- Only uncommitted state at start was this plan directory.
