# Slash Command Integrations

This page records the ctx slash-command decision for the supported agent
harnesses listed in [Provider Support](provider-support.md).

Current rule: prefer the bundled `ctx-agent-history-search` skill when the
provider exposes skills as command-like invocations. Write a separate
`/ctx-history` command file only when the provider has a current documented
file location, file format, invocation syntax, and argument behavior that ctx
can manage idempotently without editing broad user config.

The implemented command is a thin entry point. It tells the agent to use local
`ctx` search, inspect cited sessions or events, and answer with ctx citations.
It does not install hooks.

## Implemented Writers

`ctx integrations install slash-commands` currently writes these separate
entry points:

| Agent | Global path | Project path | Format | Invocation | Detection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenCode | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/commands/ctx-history.md` | `.opencode/commands/ctx-history.md` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter | `/ctx-history <query>` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` exists |
| MiMo Code | `MIMOCODE_CONFIG_DIR/commands/ctx-history.md`, `MIMOCODE_HOME/config/commands/ctx-history.md`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimocode/commands/ctx-history.md` | `.mimocode/commands/ctx-history.md` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter | `/ctx-history <query>` | `MIMOCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, absolute `MIMOCODE_HOME`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimocode` exists |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/commands/ctx-history.toml` | `.gemini/commands/ctx-history.toml` | TOML custom command | `/ctx-history <query>` | `~/.gemini` exists |
| Qwen Code | `~/.qwen/commands/ctx-history.md` | `.qwen/commands/ctx-history.md` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter and `{{args}}` | `/ctx-history <query>` | `~/.qwen` exists |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/global_workflows/ctx-history.md` | `.windsurf/workflows/ctx-history.md` | Markdown workflow | `/ctx-history` | `~/.codeium/windsurf` exists |

Each writer stores `.ctx-slash-commands.json` beside the generated command. A
reinstall refreshes stale ctx-owned files, leaves locally modified files alone,
and requires `--force` to replace a modified file. A future remove operation
should only delete the exact managed command file when the current hash matches
the metadata or the user explicitly requests a forced remove.

Skill-only providers are intentionally not written through this command. Use
`ctx integrations install skills` for the providers already supported by the
skill installer.

## Automated Coverage

The Bazel target `//:slash_command_e2e` runs hermetic fake-harness tests for the
implemented file writers. Those tests execute the real ctx installer with
temporary home and config directories, discover the generated files from the
documented provider paths, parse the provider command formats, and substitute a
multi-word query through the provider argument token where the provider supports
one. Windsurf is covered as a workflow-readiness parser because its invocation
and reload path is UI/manual.

Optional live-harness smoke tests should stay outside the default Bazel gate.
They require installed third-party CLIs or desktop UI state and, for some
providers, interactive command reload or approval.

| Cursor | Skill-only | `~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.agents/skills` | `.cursor/skills`, `.agents/skills` | `SKILL.md` | `/<skill-name>` | Covered by `ctx integrations install skills --agent cursor`; no `.cursor/commands` writer until official layout docs are stable | [Cursor skills](https://cursor.com/docs/skills.md), [Cursor CLI slash commands](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/reference/slash-commands.md) | Cursor plugins can expose commands; the raw command-file surface is treated as migration input, not the ctx install target. |
| OpenCode | Yes, separate | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/commands` | `.opencode/commands` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter, `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1` | `/ctx-history <query>` | Implemented with metadata hash and detection by config dir | [OpenCode commands](https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/) | Separate command file is clearly documented and safe to manage. |

| Goose | Manual-only | `~/.config/goose/config.yaml` | Not documented as a file drop-in | YAML `slash_commands` mapping to recipes | `/<name>` | Do not edit YAML yet; a safe writer needs YAML round-tripping and recipe ownership | [Goose custom slash commands](https://goose-docs.ai/docs/guides/context-engineering/slash-commands/) | Goose commands are shortcuts to recipes and accept at most one parameter. |
| Continue | Manual-only | Continue assistant config | Continue assistant config | YAML prompt entries with `invokable: true` | `/<prompt-name>` | Do not edit YAML yet; a safe writer needs config discovery and round-tripping | [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli), [Continue config reference](https://docs.continue.dev/reference) | Continue prompts are invokable slash prompts, but the command is a config entry, not a standalone file in a stable command dir. |

| Auggie | Yes, deferred | `~/.augment/commands` | `.augment/commands` | Markdown with optional frontmatter | `/<command-name> [arguments]` | No ctx writer yet; Auggie also supports skills and the alias decision should be made with skill install support | [Auggie custom commands](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/custom-commands), [Auggie skills](https://docs.augmentcode.com/cli/skills) | Commands and skills are separate but share the slash surface. |
| Junie | Yes, manual/deferred | `~/.junie/commands` | `.junie/commands` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter | `/<command> name=value` | No ctx writer; Junie requires named arguments declared in the prompt | [Junie custom slash commands](https://junie.jetbrains.com/docs/custom-slash-commands.html) | The generic `/ctx-history <query>` shape does not map cleanly to Junie's named-argument command model. |
