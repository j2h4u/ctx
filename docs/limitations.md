# Limitations

ctx is production-scoped to local history indexing and search retrieval.
These limitations are intentional unless another document says a capability has
shipped.

## Provider Coverage

- Codex local import is supported for documented local JSONL sources.
- Pi local import is supported when matching local session JSONL files exist
  under `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, or when an explicit Pi session JSONL file is
  passed with `--path`.
- Additional supported agent harnesses are listed in the provider matrix and are
  imported only when their documented local history paths exist and match the
  supported native formats.
- NanoClaw local import is explicit-path support and is not included in
  `ctx import --all` or pre-search refresh. AstrBot is supported for bounded
  `data_v4.db` locations and imports local LLM context plus available platform
  history rows when present, but upstream AstrBot still treats non-WebChat raw
  IM replies as platform-side history rather than guaranteed `data_v4.db`
  transcript rows.
- Unknown provider formats should not be parsed optimistically.

## Import Semantics

- Imports are explicit unless non-JSON `ctx setup`, native-provider
  `ctx import`, or `ctx daemon run` starts ctx-owned local daemon maintenance.
  Setup/import autostart uses the normal background daemon profile and exits
  after it becomes idle; explicit `ctx daemon run` runs the same coordinator in
  the foreground. Use
  `ctx setup --no-daemon` or `ctx import --no-daemon` for a one-run autostart
  opt-out. Semantic catch-up runs only when the required local model cache
  already exists.
- Current importers use idempotent rescans.
- `--resume` is reported in output but is not a universal provider cursor
  contract.
- Explicit `--path` imports are not remembered as future defaults.

## Search Semantics

- Search quality depends on what providers expose and what importers index.
- Large outputs may be represented as bounded previews.
- Ranking is deterministic for the same local database and options, but it is
  not a claim of semantic understanding.
- Empty or punctuation-only search is invalid. Broad valid queries can still
  return metadata-driven matches.
- Semantic embeddings depend on a compatible local ONNX Runtime backend.
  The current public release artifacts are lexical-only on every platform and
  report semantic unavailable rather than linking a target-specific backend.

## Retrieval Semantics

- Search output is retrieval material, not generated analysis.
- Token counts are estimates.
- If a raw source moves, ctx may still return indexed text from SQLite.
- JSON is local/private and can include sensitive content.

## Operations

- Core setup/import/search are local filesystem operations.
- Official installer-managed binaries can use signed release metadata for
  `ctx upgrade` and managed background auto-upgrade checks.
- Unmanaged installs do not self-upgrade.
- No provider beyond the support matrix should be described as supported.
